        I'm 47 years old and broke, living in my mom's basement. I've isolated
        myself from society because I'm ashamed of who I've become and the
        situation I'm in. But today, right now, I'm vowing to restart my life.
        I'm dropping everything to focus on web and personal development. For
        how long? I don't know, but I don't have much time, so it better happen
        fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sharing my journey from fuck-up to successful web developer, using
        what I learn along the way to turn this basic page into a web app that
        helps you level up too.
