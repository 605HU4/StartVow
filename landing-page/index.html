        Start Vow — Build habits by promising to yourself, not by checking boxes
      </h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <article>
        <section>
          <h2>What Start Vow is</h2>
          <p>
            Start Vow is a habit-building web app (startvow.com) that treats
            commitment like a promise rather than a daily checklist. Instead of
            forcing you to click a box every day, Start Vow asks you to set a
            clear start date, write a short personal vow, and then assumes you
            will honor that commitment. The app defaults to trust, tracks
            assumed compliance, and surfaces real accountability through social
            and leaderboard features.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is simple: reduce friction, increase psychological
            ownership, and make the act of starting more powerful than the tiny
            ritual of ticking a box. If you’ve tried habit trackers that feel
            like chores, Start Vow flips the script — beginning is the act of
            integrity.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How Start Vow works</h2>
          <p>
            First, you create a habit and pick a start date. That start date is
            the moment you publicly (or privately) commit to the habit. Then you
            write a short vow — one or two sentences that explain why this habit
            matters to you. The vow is the contract you keep with yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the start date onward, Start Vow assumes daily compliance. If
            you miss a day, the app records a break in the assumed streak and
            prompts reflection: did you actually miss it, or did you follow
            through and forget to mark it? You can confirm compliance
            retroactively, but the default assumption is that you meant to do
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            That assumption is the design choice that changes behavior. By
            beginning with trust, Start Vow makes starting feel meaningful. The
            app then layers lightweight nudges, social accountability, and a
            leaderboard so your promise carries social weight when you choose to
            share it.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Why this is different from other habit trackers</h2>
          <p>
            Most habit apps reduce the practice to binary daily actions: check
            or don’t check. That works for some people, but it trains
            reward-seeking around clicking rather than acting. Start Vow
            prioritizes the moment of decision — the promise — and treats
            follow-through as the default. That subtle flip produces three
            advantages:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it lowers friction. You don’t need to remember to open an app
            each morning; the habit is already assumed unless you indicate
            otherwise. Second, it emphasizes identity and intention. Writing a
            vow anchors the habit to a value or purpose, which studies show
            improves persistence. Third, it uses social dynamics thoughtfully:
            when people can see your vow or your leaderboard position, social
            norms and gentle competition increase motivation without gamified
            noise.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>The psychology behind Start Vow</h2>
          <p>
            Start Vow borrows from behavior science and commonsense design.
            Commitment devices — actions that lock you into a future course —
            boost follow-through. Writing a vow is a simple commitment device:
            it externalizes intent and makes the decision more concrete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app also leans on identity-based habit change. When you describe
            yourself as “someone who meditates every morning” or “a person who
            writes daily,” you align your actions with a self-image. The vow
            helps form that identity faster than repeated checkbox clicks
            because the vow is a statement about who you want to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, Start Vow uses social proof and lightweight competition.
            Leaderboards and visible promises increase accountability by
            introducing mild social stakes: people don’t like being the only one
            who breaks a publicly stated vow.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Core features</h2>
          <p>
            Start Vow focuses on a concise set of features that support
            sustained change: create a habit with a start date, write a short
            vow, choose privacy level (private, friends, or public), and join or
            create small groups. The app assumes compliance by default, shows
            streaks based on that assumption, and logs any breaks or
            confirmations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaderboards rank users in optional communities, emphasizing longest
            upheld vows and consistency of assumed compliance. Reflection
            prompts appear when breaks happen to turn lapses into learning
            moments instead of sources of shame.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additional features include retroactive confirmation (if you did the
            habit but forgot to mark it), exportable progress reports, and
            integration options for notifications or calendar reminders for
            those who want them. Privacy controls let you keep vows private or
            selectively share them with friends or groups for social
            accountability.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Social accountability without toxicity</h2>
          <p>
            Leaderboards and social features can boost motivation — or become
            competitive traps. Start Vow is designed to encourage healthy
            accountability. Leaderboards are opt-in and organized around
            supportive groups rather than public shaming. The app surfaces
            stories of progress and learning, not just raw scores.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you join a group, the leaderboard highlights consistency,
            percentage of days honored, and the number of reflections written
            after missed days. This invites empathy and curiosity: people see
            not only results but the context behind them.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Getting started — a quick walkthrough</h2>
          <p>
            Start by choosing one habit. Keep it narrow and specific. Pick a
            realistic start date — tomorrow, next Monday, or a meaningful date —
            and write your vow. Your vow should be short and true: “I vow to do
            10 minutes of writing every morning to build my daily creative
            habit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Decide who sees your vow. If you’re testing the app, you might keep
            it private. If you want extra push, share it with a friend or a
            small group. Then let the app assume compliance and watch how your
            behavior changes when beginning becomes an act of promise rather
            than an extra task.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Typical use cases</h2>
          <p>
            People use Start Vow for micro habits and life habits alike: morning
            pages, meditation, daily exercise, reading, language practice,
            stretching, or even consistent creative work. It’s also useful for
            habits that need identity reinforcement, like “I am a runner” or “I
            make space for deep work every day.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Teams and small communities can use Start Vow to coordinate cultural
            changes — for example, a team vow to have a short daily check-in or
            a company initiative to encourage healthier routines.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Privacy and trust</h2>
          <p>
            Start Vow treats your vows and data with care. You control who sees
            your commitments. Public sharing is optional, and personal data is
            never used for advertising. The app focuses on building trust: your
            vow is yours, and any social features are designed to empower, not
            expose.
          </p>
          <p>
            We plan clear export and deletion options so you can always take
            your progress with you or remove it entirely. If you value privacy,
            Start Vow is built to respect that.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Why Start Vow might work for you</h2>
          <p>
            If you’ve tried habit trackers that turned into guilt machines,
            Start Vow offers a different path: start with trust, anchor with a
            vow, and add social weight selectively. Beginning becomes
            meaningful, slipping becomes instructive, and progress is tracked
            without the ritualized friction of daily check-ins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app suits people who respond to identity-based change, those who
            prefer low-friction tools, and groups who want gentle
            accountability. It’s intentionally simple and psychologically
            informed.
          </p>
